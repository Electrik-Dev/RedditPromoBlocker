# Reddit Promo blocker

### About
This is my first chrome extension, so please keep that in mind.
I have multiple ad blockers on my browser, but for some reason promoted posts were still getting through,
so I decided that this would be a good first chrome extension to make.
Right now it is only made for chrome, but I will work on a firefox version as well.
